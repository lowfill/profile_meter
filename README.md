Profile Meter elgg plugin
by Liran Tal of Enginx <liran@enginx.com>


== DESCRIPTION ==

The plugin's aim is to be as flexible as possible and allow to present a real
profile completeness progress bar based on the fields which the administrator
specify for the user.

Thus, this plugin will work with new fields that you add and with such profile
managers like Kevin's Form plugin.
